# Set

The usual tool in mathematics to do so is the notion of a set. Any collection of things, called elements, is a set.

If A is a set and b is an element of A, we write b ∈ A. The number of elements of a set A (also called the cardinality of A) is denoted by |A|.

A set A is called a subset of a set B, if every element of A is also an element of B.
The relation that A is a subset of B is denoted by A ⊆ B.

The intersection of two sets is the set consisting of those elements that elements of both sets. The intersection of two sets A and B is denoted by A ∩ B.
Two sets whose intersection is the empty set (in other words, have no element in common) are called disjoint.

# Subsets

**Theorem:** A set with n elements has 2^n subsets

A correspondence with these properties is called a one-to-one correspondence (or bijection). If we can make a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of two sets, then
they have the same number of elements.

# Sequences

**Theorem:** The number of strings of length n composed of k given elements is k^n

**Theorem:** Suppose that we want to form strings of length n so that we can use any of
a given set of k<sub>1</sub> symbols as the first element of the string, any of a given set of k2 symbols
as the second element of the string, etc., any of a given set of kn symbols as the last element
of the string. Then the total number of strings we can form is k<sub>1</sub> · k<sub>2</sub> · ... · k<sub>n</sub>.
