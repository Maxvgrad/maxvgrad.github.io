# Introduction

Algorithm has to solve a general, specified problem. We seek algorithms which _correct_ and _efficient_.
Correct - algorithm gives always a correct answer for all input.
Efficient - is measured by asymptotic notation. User can see results with a blink of an eye.
A faster algorithm running on slower machine would always win for sufficiently large instances.

## Correctness

For any algorithm we must prove that it always returns a desired output for all legal instances of the problem.
Algorithm problem should be carefully defines to allow provably correct algorithm to exist.
Algorithm correctness is not obvious in many optimization problems.
Algorithm without a proof of correctness is probably wrong. Searching for counterexample is the best way to disprove 
correctness of algorithm.
